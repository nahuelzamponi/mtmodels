# mtmodels

This repository the contains the implementations utilized in 'Zamponi N et al' to simulate mitochondrial networks dynamics using an agent-based model (AB) and a spatially-explicit model (SE).
Additional code to reproduce results from finite size saling analysis of real mitochondrial networks is also provided.

# AB model
Fortran code to implement the AB model.


# SE model
R code to implement the SE model.


# Real networks
The code to reproduce Figure 7 was writen in MATLAB (). A set of images is also provided ('images_figure7.zip').
